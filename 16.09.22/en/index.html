      <p>iOS 16 brings improvements to iMessage that have been around for a very long time. Now, when using Apple's proprietary messenger, it is possible to edit and cancel sending a message. These are very useful features when you realize you misspelled a word or sent a message to the wrong chat.

            <p>Unfortunately, there are limitations to this feature. You can only edit a message for fifteen minutes, and cancel sending for two. If a person makes a mistake, then in most cases this time will be enough to correct it. At the same time, such a restriction will save you from those who like to edit the message in their favor after some time.
